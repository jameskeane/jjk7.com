Hi!

My name is James Keane, I am a father of 3, loving husband, an experienced software developer and manager
from Toronto, Canada.

In 1994, I got a [GameGenie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie) for my
Nintendo Entertainment System. The GameGenie used a 'patch code' that told 
the genie to load a value at a certain memory address. This enabled all sorts of
cheats, such as invisibility, invulnerability, noclip, etc. I was
probably 5 or 6 years old and completely fascinated by these seemingly random codes.
Trying to understand how they worked was impossible at that age, but it didn't
stop me from trying. This experience sparked an intense curiosity for anything
computer related that has lasted into adulthood.

In 2001, I was 12 years old when I recieved a [Dreamcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast).
The Dreamcast was the very first console system to have support for online gaming.
My family never had a computer powerful enough to play games online, so the
dreamcast was my first exposure to online gaming. My favourite games were Unreal
Tournament, 4x4 Evo, and Phantasy Star Online. Playing Phantasy Start Online with
people from all over the world, including Japan was the moment that solidified
my obsession with all things internet. The internet was already quickly emerging
as a revolutionary technology at that time, but for me at 12 years old, this is
when I knew that the future was going to be different and I was going to be part
of it.

I had a pretty troubled childhood, partly due to undiagnosed ADHD that caused me
to stay up fiddling around with my computer until passing out at 5 or 6am. This
habit caused me extreme difficulties at school; missing **months** of school at
a time. Luckily, I was also a gifted child and had no trouble catching up to my
peers so that I was never held back. This continued until the summer before
grade 12.

With my experience in easily catching up, I had developed an attitude
of 'nothing except grade 12 matters'...  and I was determined to go to university.
While my peers only had to focus on 4 credits in their final year, I needed 10.
I did night school, online correspondence, every course I could take during
the day; and some 'make-up' independent study assignments. I also joined the
football team, started exercising everyday, and started dating an amazing girl
who later became my wife.

I don't want to say I 'peaked in highschool', but that year was certainly a top 5
and the reason I was unknowingly treating my ADHD with a fat burner (ephedrine).

I was a completely different person and despite the almost insurmountable
challenge, I got into one of the top universities in Canada and eventually
graduated with a prestigious honours degree in Computer Science with distinction
from The University of Toronto. It was also very "easy" and I sometimes struggle
with knowing that I probably could've gone to a more prestigious university, or
'achieved' more. 

With this blog, I hope to contribute to the zeitgeist even though I know that I'm
probably just talking to the wind. If you've read this far, thanks for listening,
send me a note or connect on linkedin if you want.

<!-- 
My entire childhood I was blamed for 'wasting my potential', that it was _my fault_
for not using my gifts for greatness. But I was just a child and none of the adults
in my life recognized that I was ADHD. I am now faced with a similar situation,
my son is also extremely gifted but struggles with attention.  -->
