In 2016, I accidentally discovered a way to take dynamic wide angle shots using
a cell phone with the Google Camera app. I'm probably not the first to discover
this, but anyways; it produces really cool results.

Using the 'Photo Sphere' feature, only snap the first few angles; don't do the
full sphere. Let it stitch those together and you get some really cool wide
angle shots:
